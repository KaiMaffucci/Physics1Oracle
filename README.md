# PhysicsIOracle
A module (maybe soon to be library?) of functions to help solve basic physics problems.

For now, it's just a single python 3 file.
Download it and run it in your favorite python 3 shell to load all of the functions in the module.
Type 'oracle_help()' to see a list of all the kinds of commands you can run. From there type 'oracle_help(category you want)' to get a list of functions on a given topic.
