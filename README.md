# PhysicsIOracle
A module (maybe soon to be library?) of functions to help solve basic physics problems.

NOTICE: There are known problems with this module, but it has been quite some time since I've been in Physics I class, and I don't have the time to go back and fix it. If anyone finds any problems and want to push a fix, go for it and I'll review it. 

For now, it's just a single python 3 file.
Download it and run it in your favorite python 3 shell to load all of the functions in the module.
Type 'oracle_help()' to see a list of all the kinds of commands you can run. From there type 'oracle_help(category you want)' to get a list of functions on a given topic. Found a function and unsure how to use it? Look for the function in the code, there are high-detail comments for all of them.
